# Specification Quality Checklist: Barcode Label Quantity Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding
to planning  
**Created**: 2026-02-14  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:

- Requirements and scenarios focus on administrator and laboratory user
  outcomes.
- The specification defines behavior (what/why) rather than code-level approach.
- Mandatory sections are complete: User Scenarios, Edge Cases, Requirements,
  Success Criteria.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:

- No clarification markers are present.
- Functional requirements FR-001 through FR-012 are independently testable.
- Success criteria SC-001 through SC-005 include measurable outcomes.
- Edge cases include malformed configuration, missing quantities, duplicate
  records, and limit enforcement.
- Assumptions/constraints and Out of Scope sections define boundaries clearly.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:

- User stories cover: admin configuration, sample-order persistence, and
  resilient label generation.
- Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then and map to functional requirements.
- Success criteria are aligned with persistence integrity, localization
  coverage, and workflow stability.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

**Summary**:

- Specification is complete and aligned with OGC-284 scope.
- Feature ID uses the issue number convention (`OGC-284`).
- No unresolved clarification items remain.

**Next Steps**:

1. Run `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning artifacts.
2. Ensure milestone planning is added if estimated effort exceeds 3 days.
