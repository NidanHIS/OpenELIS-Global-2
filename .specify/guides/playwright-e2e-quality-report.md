## Anti-Patterns Found in OpenELIS Tests

### 1. `waitForResponse` as Primary Assertion

**File:** `frontend/playwright/helpers/accept-results.ts` (lines 68-92)

The `acceptAndVerifyResults` helper uses `page.waitForResponse()` to intercept
the POST to `/rest/AnalyzerResults` and then checks `saveResponse.ok()` as the
primary success signal. While the helper does follow up with UI assertions
(waiting for the page to reload and verifying staged rows disappear), the
`waitForResponse` acts as the critical gate -- if the server returns 500, the
helper throws a programmatic error with body text rather than letting the UI
failure manifest naturally.

```typescript
// accept-results.ts lines 68-92
const saveResponsePromise = page.waitForResponse(
  (res) =>
    res.url().includes("/rest/AnalyzerResults") &&
    res.request().method() === "POST",
  { timeout: 60_000 }
);
await saveButton.click();
// ... then checks saveResponse.ok() and throws if not
```

**Why it matters:** When the backend returns HTTP 500, this throws a generic
error before the UI has a chance to render an error notification. CI screenshots
capture a stale page state, making diagnosis impossible.

**Better approach:** Use `waitForResponse` purely for synchronization (knowing
the POST completed), then assert on the visible success/error UI state. Let the
UI tell the story.

### 2. Autocomplete Polling with 12s Timeout

**File:** `frontend/playwright/tests/ogc-284-barcode-workflow.spec.ts` (lines
18-32)

The `pickFirstAutosuggestOptional` function uses `expect.poll()` with a
12-second timeout and custom intervals to wait for autocomplete dropdown
suggestions to appear, then clicks the first one. If the dropdown never appears,
it falls back to pressing Tab.

```typescript
// ogc-284-barcode-workflow.spec.ts lines 18-32
async function pickFirstAutosuggestOptional(page: Page, pause: PauseFn) {
  try {
    await expect
      .poll(async () => page.locator('[data-cy="auto-suggestion"]').count(), {
        timeout: 12_000,
        intervals: [400, 800, 1500],
      })
      .toBeGreaterThan(0);
    await page.locator('[data-cy="auto-suggestion"]').first().click();
  } catch {
    await page.keyboard.press("Tab");
  }
}
```

**Why it matters:** This is called twice in `fillOrderDetails` (for site name
and requester lookup), adding up to 24 seconds of potential polling time per
order. The `[data-cy="auto-suggestion"]` selector is a Cypress-era attribute
being used in Playwright tests. The try/catch silently swallows failures,
masking real issues.

**Better approach:** For known values in E2E fixtures, type the full value and
press Tab. Autocomplete is a UX convenience, not the interaction path tests
should exercise.

### 3. `{ force: true }` Bypassing Actionability Checks

Multiple files use `{ force: true }` on click and check operations:

| File                               | Line | Usage                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ogc-284-barcode-workflow.spec.ts` | 163  | `await firstRadio.check({ force: true })`                         |
| `ogc-284-barcode-workflow.spec.ts` | 199  | `await genderMale.check({ force: true })`                         |
| `ogc-284-labels-ui.spec.ts`        | 9    | `.click({ force: true })`                                         |
| `accept-results.ts`                | 53   | `await acceptAllCheckbox.check({ force: true })`                  |
| `barcode-configuration.spec.ts`    | 60   | `await collectionDateCheckbox.setChecked(false, { force: true })` |

**Why it matters:** `{ force: true }` bypasses Playwright's actionability checks
(visibility, enabled state, not intercepted by overlay). This means the test may
"pass" even when the element is not actually interactable by a real user. In the
Carbon Design System, checkboxes and radio buttons have overlaid label elements
that intentionally receive pointer events -- `force: true` works around this but
masks real actionability regressions.

**Better approach:** Click the associated `<label>` element instead of forcing
the hidden `<input>`. For Carbon checkboxes/radios, this is the correct user
interaction path.

### 4. No Assertions in Demo/Video Test Steps

Several demo tests contain long sequences of UI interactions with no `expect()`
assertions. For example:

**File:** `ogc-284-barcode-workflow.spec.ts` -- "US3" test (lines 597-713)

Large portions of US3 are purely navigational with no assertions:

- Lines 651-665: Scrolls to print dialog elements, checks visibility with
  `.catch(() => false)`, but never asserts on outcome
- Lines 676-679: Checks for Done button visibility with `.catch(() => false)`
  but no assertion
- Lines 693-703: Navigates to Print Barcode page and scrolls around with no
  assertions

**Why it matters:** A test without assertions is a "fire-and-forget" navigation
script. It provides no regression protection. If the feature breaks, the test
still passes.

**Better approach:** Even demo tests should have at least one meaningful
assertion per logical step using `test.step()` annotations.

### 5. Manual POM Construction Instead of Fixture Injection

Most tests that use Page Objects construct them manually:

```typescript
// Common pattern across tests
const list = new AnalyzerListPage(page);
const form = new AnalyzerFormPage(page);
```

While some tests use POMs well (analyzer-list.spec.ts, analyzer-form.spec.ts,
error-dashboard.spec.ts), others bypass POMs entirely and use raw locators
(ogc-284-barcode-workflow.spec.ts, file-import-ui.spec.ts, navbar.spec.ts).

**Why it matters:** Manual construction is boilerplate-heavy and error-prone.
Playwright's `test.extend()` fixture system provides automatic dependency
injection, proper setup/teardown lifecycle, and composability.

**Better approach:** Define POMs as Playwright fixtures:

```typescript
import { test as base } from "@playwright/test";
const test = base.extend<{ analyzerList: AnalyzerListPage }>({
  analyzerList: async ({ page }, use) => {
    const list = new AnalyzerListPage(page);
    await use(list);
  },
});
```

### 6. Pure API Tests Without UI Interaction

**File:** `frontend/playwright/tests/file-import.spec.ts` (entire file)

This test file contains three test groups that exclusively use `page.request.*`
API calls with zero UI interactions. No page navigation, no DOM assertions.

```typescript
// file-import.spec.ts lines 48-69 (representative)
const listRes = await page.request.get(`${api}/analyzers`);
expect(listRes.ok()).toBeTruthy();
const { analyzers } = (await listRes.json()) as { ... };
const found = analyzers.find((a) => a.name === analyzer.name);
expect(found).toBeDefined();
```

**Why it matters:** These are API integration tests masquerading as E2E tests.
They inflate E2E suite runtime without testing any user-facing behavior. They
belong in backend integration tests or a separate API test suite.

### 7. Catching and Ignoring Errors

Multiple files use `.catch(() => false)` or `.catch(() => {})` to silently
swallow errors:

| File                               | Line    | Pattern                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `accept-results.ts`                | 82      | `}).catch(() => { /* Some runs complete quickly */ })` |
| `ogc-284-barcode-workflow.spec.ts` | 84      | `.isVisible({ timeout: 2_000 }).catch(() => false)`    |
| `ogc-284-barcode-workflow.spec.ts` | 124     | `.isVisible({ timeout: 3000 }).catch(() => false)`     |
| `ogc-284-barcode-workflow.spec.ts` | 188     | `.isVisible({ timeout: 5000 }).catch(() => false)`     |
| `ogc-284-barcode-workflow.spec.ts` | 197-198 | `.isChecked().catch(() => false)`                      |
| `ogc-284-barcode-workflow.spec.ts` | 199     | `.isVisible().catch(() => false)`                      |
| `ogc-284-barcode-workflow.spec.ts` | 205     | `.isVisible().catch(() => false)`                      |
| `analyzer-plugin-config.spec.ts`   | 32      | `.catch(() => {})`                                     |
| `analyzer-plugin-config.spec.ts`   | 60      | `.catch(() => {})`                                     |

**Why it matters:** Silent error swallowing creates invisible failures. When a
DOM element is unexpectedly missing, the test silently skips the interaction
instead of failing. This means broken features can pass CI green.

### 8. `page.waitForTimeout()` in Non-Video Helpers

**File:** `frontend/playwright/helpers/title-card.ts` (lines 63, 107)

The `showTitleCard` and `showStepCard` functions use `page.waitForTimeout()` for
their display duration. While these are no-op outside video projects (gated by
`isVideoProject`), the pattern normalizes `waitForTimeout` usage.

**File:** `frontend/playwright/helpers/results-ui.ts` (lines 78-106)

The `navigateUntilVisible` function implements a retry loop that navigates to a
URL and waits for a locator to become visible, retrying on failure. This is a
polling pattern that works around timing issues rather than using proper
Playwright auto-waiting.

### 9. Network Interception Used as Assertion

**File:** `frontend/playwright/tests/barcode-configuration.spec.ts` (lines
28-45)

This test intercepts `**/rest/BarcodeConfiguration` to mock the API, then
asserts on the mock's state. While API mocking is a valid technique, this test
never verifies the actual network call happened -- it only verifies the mock was
set up correctly.

---

## Modern Best Practices (2025-2026)

### 1. Use `waitForResponse` ONLY for Synchronization

`waitForResponse` should synchronize test flow (wait for a network call to
complete before proceeding), never serve as the primary assertion. Always follow
with a visible UI state assertion.

```typescript
// Synchronize on network completion
const responsePromise = page.waitForResponse("**/api/save");
await saveButton.click();
await responsePromise; // Wait for network, but don't assert on it

// Assert on visible UI state
await expect(page.getByText("Saved successfully")).toBeVisible();
```

### 2. Type Full Text + Tab for Known Values

For autocomplete fields with known test data values, type the complete value and
Tab out. Never poll for autocomplete dropdown suggestions in tests.

```typescript
// BAD: Poll for autocomplete dropdown
await input.fill("CAMES");
await expect.poll(() => page.locator(".suggestion").count()).toBeGreaterThan(0);
await page.locator(".suggestion").first().click();

// GOOD: Type full value and move on
await input.fill("CAMES MAN");
await input.press("Tab");
```

### 3. Use Web-First Assertions

Playwright's `expect()` assertions auto-retry. Never use one-shot checks like
`isVisible()` for assertions.

```typescript
// BAD: One-shot check (no retry)
const visible = await element.isVisible();
expect(visible).toBeTruthy();

// GOOD: Web-first assertion (auto-retries)
await expect(element).toBeVisible();
```

### 4. Use `test.step()` for Multi-Step Workflows

Instead of long sequential test bodies, use `test.step()` to create named
sections. This improves trace readability and failure diagnostics.

```typescript
test("complete order workflow", async ({ page }) => {
  await test.step("Select patient", async () => {
    // ...
  });

  await test.step("Fill sample details", async () => {
    // ...
  });

  await test.step("Submit order", async () => {
    // ...
  });
});
```

### 5. API-First Test Data Setup

Use REST API calls in `beforeAll` or fixtures to create test data instead of
navigating through the UI. This is 10x faster and more reliable.

```typescript
test.beforeAll(async ({ request }) => {
  await request.post("/api/test-data/patients", {
    data: { lastName: "TEST-Smith", firstName: "John" },
  });
});
```

### 6. ARIA Snapshot Testing for Carbon Forms

Playwright 1.49+ supports ARIA snapshot testing, which captures the accessible
tree of a component. This is ideal for Carbon Design System forms where the
accessible structure is well-defined.

```typescript
await expect(page.getByTestId("order-form")).toMatchAriaSnapshot(`
  - form "Add Order":
    - textbox "Patient Name"
    - combobox "Sample Type"
    - button "Submit"
`);
```

### 7. Soft Assertions for Transient Notifications

Use soft assertions with custom error messages for elements like toast
notifications that may disappear quickly.

```typescript
await expect
  .soft(
    page.getByRole("alert"),
    "Success notification should appear after save"
  )
  .toBeVisible({ timeout: 10_000 });
```

---

## Tooling Recommendations

### 1. `eslint-plugin-playwright`

**Status:** Not installed (confirmed by checking `frontend/package.json`).

**Install:**

```bash
cd frontend && npm install -D eslint-plugin-playwright
```

**Configure** (add to `.eslintrc` or create `frontend/.eslintrc.playwright.js`):

```javascript
module.exports = {
  extends: ["plugin:playwright/recommended"],
  rules: {
    "playwright/no-wait-for-timeout": "error",
    "playwright/prefer-web-first-assertions": "warn",
    "playwright/no-force-option": "warn",
    "playwright/no-page-pause": "error",
    "playwright/expect-expect": "warn",
    "playwright/no-conditional-expect": "warn",
    "playwright/no-conditional-in-test": "warn",
  },
};
```

**Key rules:**

| Rule                          | Purpose                           | Current Violations                                           |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `no-wait-for-timeout`         | Prevents `page.waitForTimeout()`  | title-card.ts (2), video-pause.ts (1), results-ui retry loop |
| `prefer-web-first-assertions` | Enforces auto-retrying assertions | Multiple `.isVisible()` one-shot checks                      |
| `no-force-option`             | Flags `{ force: true }`           | 5 instances across 3 files                                   |
| `expect-expect`               | Requires assertions in tests      | Demo test steps with no expects                              |
| `no-conditional-expect`       | Flags `expect` inside try/catch   | accept-results.ts, analyzer-test-connection.spec.ts          |

### 2. Playwright MCP Server

Enable AI-assisted test development with the Playwright MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest
```

This provides the LLM with direct browser interaction capabilities for debugging
and understanding DOM state during test development.

### 3. Playwright Test Agents

Playwright's experimental test agent support (planner/generator/healer pattern):

```bash
npx playwright init-agents --loop=claude
```

This enables three-phase test generation:

1. **Planner**: Analyzes the page and creates a test plan
2. **Generator**: Writes the test code from the plan
3. **Healer**: Fixes broken selectors automatically on failure

### 4. Flakiness Detection

Before merging any new or modified Playwright test, run with `--repeat-each=3`:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run pw:test -- --repeat-each=3 --project=core-app
```

This catches flaky tests before they enter the CI pipeline.
